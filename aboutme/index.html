    <h2>Haydee De la Sota</h2>
    <h2>Haydee</h2>
    <p>My name is Haydee and they only call me just Haydee.</p>
    <p>I live in Mexico and I really like my country, my efforts are in studying the Software Development degree, I like to work in my garden and learn new things, also go outings with my family.</p>
    <p>In November I have been married for 10 years and I have 3 children who have been my motivation to continue developing academically.</p>
    <p>Before I get married I studied Computer Systems Engineering but I was not able to finish so now I want to finish since I really like programming.</p>
    <p>I am very happy to pursue a degree at BYU Pathway because it inspires me spiritually and I have the opportunity to develop and work from my computer at home.</p>
    <p>I have been an LDS member for 17 years.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite scriptures is:</p>
      <p> "Ether 12:27
        And if men come unto me I will show them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them."</p>
        <p>This scripture strengthens me whenever I find myself discouraged.</p>
        <p>I am happy to meet you and continue learning, have a wonderful weekend!</p>
