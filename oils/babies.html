        <div class="note"><h4>Important: Essential oils must always be diluted before applying them to babies and children. Start with small amounts and repeat as often as needed, up to every 15 minutes. The soles of the feet are ideal for applications on babies as they are less likely to get oil into their eyes. If this happens, always wipe with coconut or olive oil until the discomfort is gone; never with water.</h4>

        <p>The extraction of therapeutic-grade essential oils is a specialized process involving the retrieval of concentrated aromatic compounds from plants, flowers, leaves, roots, and other botanical parts. These essential oils not only contribute pleasant fragrances but are also valued for their therapeutic properties. Therapeutic grade refers to the purity and potency of the oil, ensuring that it retains its health benefits.
        
        The most common extraction method is steam distillation, where the plant is subjected to steam, releasing its volatile oils. Other methods include cold-press extraction for citrus fruits and solvent extraction for more delicate plants.
        
        Therapeutic quality is achieved through the selection of high-quality plants, careful distillation, and the absence of contaminants. These oils contain bioactive compounds that can positively influence mental, physical, and emotional health. They are used in aromatherapy, massages, and even in the cosmetic and personal care industry.
        
        It is crucial to obtain essential oils from reliable suppliers following ethical and transparent practices. The popularity of therapeutic-grade essential oils has grown due to increasing awareness of well-being and holistic care, supporting the idea that these extracts can contribute to a more balanced and healthy life.</p>
